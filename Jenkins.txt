Using Newman with the Postman API
1 Generate an API key
2 Fetch a list of your collections from: https://api.getpostman.com/collections?apikey=$apiKey
3 Get the collection link via it's uid: https://api.getpostman.com/collections/$uid?apikey=$apiKey
4 Obtain the environment URI from: https://api.getpostman.com/environments?apikey=$apiKey
5 Using the collection and environment URIs acquired in steps 3 and 4, run the collection as follows:

$ newman run "https://api.getpostman.com/collections/$uid?apikey=$apiKey" \
    --environment "https://api.getpostman.com/environments/$uid?apikey=$apiKey"
